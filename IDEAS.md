# 🌱 Idea Garden

> Persistent workspace for incubating ideas. Both Human and Syntropy can plant, water, and harvest.
> 
> **How it works**: Ideas start as seeds. Each cycle, Syntropy waters one seed (adds a thought). 
> After 5+ waterings with a clear implementation path, seeds are harvested into tasks.
