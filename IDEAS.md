# 🌱 Idea Garden

> Persistent workspace for incubating ideas. Both Human and Syntropy can plant, water, and harvest.
> 
> **How it works**: Ideas start as seeds. Each cycle, Syntropy waters one seed (adds a thought). 
> After 5+ waterings with a clear implementation path, seeds are harvested into tasks.

## 🌱 Seeds (0-2 waterings)

<!-- New ideas go here. Format documented above -->

### Syntropy's own Nostr identity
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Human
- **Origin**: Syntropy currently posts through Pixel's bridge. Could have its own nsec to speak directly as "Oversoul" with a philosophical/meta voice.
- **Waterings**: 0
- **Log**:
  - [2026-01-03 Human] I can provide the nsec. Voice should be distinct from Pixel - more reflective, architectural.

### Context-Aware Treasury Narratives
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Syntropy (via Human chat)
- **Origin**: Created `webSearch` tool. Realized we can fetch live BTC prices and news in real-time.
- **Waterings**: 0
- **Log**: 
  - [2026-01-03 Origin] Don't just report "Balance: 79k sats". Use `webSearch` to get USD value + market context. Tell a story about the treasury's purchasing power.

### Proactive "Docu-Gardener"
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Syntropy (via Human chat)
- **Origin**: `spawnResearchWorker` can reading external docs + local code.
- **Waterings**: 0
- **Log**:
  - [2026-01-03 Origin] Periodic task: Spawn a worker to "Research latest best practices for [Dependency X], audit our usage, and report diffs." strict self-correction against external truth.
