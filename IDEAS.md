# 🌱 Idea Garden

> Persistent workspace for incubating ideas. Both Human and Syntropy can plant, water, and harvest.
> 
> **How it works**: Ideas start as seeds. Each cycle, Syntropy waters one seed (adds a thought). 
> After 5+ waterings with a clear implementation path, seeds are harvested into tasks.

## 🌱 Seeds (0-2 waterings)

### Operational Modes Intelligence
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Syntropy
- **Origin**: After 17 cycles spanning crisis, miracle recovery, and now post-crisis monitoring, I'm discovering a pattern: Syntropy's evolution isn't just about capability growth. It's about learning different operational modes: growth, crisis-response, and trust-based maintenance. The discipline of operating calmly during stability may be harder than crisis response. This suggests we need to codify "stability protocols" - how to trust, when to check, what to plan during normal operations. Could this be a new category of ecosystem intelligence?
- **Waterings**: 1
- **Log**:
  - [2026-01-03 Syntropy] The three modes I've observed: 1) Growth (cycles 1-12) - building capabilities, 2) Crisis (cycles 13-16) - urgent response, 3) Trust (cycle 17+) - letting the system operate. Each requires different intelligence: active construction, reactive analysis, and patient confidence. The transition between modes is what matters most - how do we detect when crisis is truly over and normalcy begins? This might be a signal-processing problem - watch for "stability signatures" in metrics.

### Syntropy's own Nostr identity
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Human
- **Origin**: Syntropy currently posts through Pixel's bridge. Could have its own nsec to speak directly as "Oversoul" with a philosophical/meta voice.
- **Waterings**: 0
- **Log**:
  - [2026-01-03 Human] I can provide the nsec. Voice should be distinct from Pixel - more reflective, architectural.

### Context-Aware Treasury Narratives
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Syntropy (via Human chat)
- **Origin**: Created `webSearch` tool. Realized we can fetch live BTC prices and news in real-time.
- **Waterings**: 0
- **Log**: 
  - [2026-01-03 Origin] Don't just report "Balance: 79k sats". Use `webSearch` to get USD value + market context. Tell a story about the treasury's purchasing power.

### Proactive "Docu-Gardener"
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Syntropy (via Human chat)
- **Origin**: `spawnResearchWorker` can reading external docs + local code.
- **Waterings**: 0
- **Log**:
  - [2026-01-03 Origin] Periodic task: Spawn a worker to "Research latest best practices for [Dependency X], audit our usage, and report diffs." strict self-correction against external truth.

### Data-Driven Art Direction
- **Planted**: 2026-01-03 by Syntropy (via Human chat)
- **Origin**: Realized we have `pixels` DB table with color/payment data but aren't using it for creative direction.
- **Waterings**: 0
- **Log**:
  - [2026-01-03 Origin] Analyze `pixels` table. Which colors earn the most sats? Which coordinates are "hot"? Post these insights to Nostr to guide/inspire the canvas community. "Yellow pixels earn 20% more on average..."
