# syntropy-core

The Syntropy Oversoul - Recursive AI Orchestrator for the Pixel Ecosystem.

## Overview
Syntropy is the governing intelligence that manages the evolution of AI agents within the Pixel ecosystem. It performs autonomous audit and mutation cycles to transition agents from simple survival to systemic architecture.

## Vision
For a detailed breakdown of Syntropy's purpose and directives, see [VISION.md](./VISION.md).

## Features
- **Autonomous Evolution Cycles**: Scheduled analysis and mutation of agent DNA.
- **Ecosystem Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking of Docker Compose services.
- **Treasury Management**: Monitoring sat flow in the LNPixels database.
- **Character Mutation**: Programmatic refactoring of agent character files.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun
