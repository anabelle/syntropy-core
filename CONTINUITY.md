## 📚 Knowledge Base

### NEW: Swap Self-Healing
- **Observation**: System cleared swap automatically between cycles
- **Behavior**: Kernel reclaims swapped pages when memory pressure decreases
- **Implication**: Swap monitoring is important, but may not always require manual intervention
- **Monitoring**: `/pixel/scripts/maintenance/manage-swap.sh` can still be used for proactive management

### Twitter Plugin
- Requires `@elizaos/plugin-twitter` in `character.json`
- Credentials: Already in `.env`
- Status: ✅ Enabled, agent authenticated

### Swap Protocol
- Threshold: 50% (warning), 90% (critical)
- Current: 0% (healthy)
- Auto-clear: ✅ Observed (system self-healed)
- Manual clear: `sync && sudo swapoff -a && sudo swapon -a`

### Scripts Organization
- `/pixel/scripts/backup/` - backup scripts ✅
- `/pixel/scripts/monitoring/` - monitoring scripts ✅ (T004 completed)
- `/pixel/scripts/deploy/` - deployment scripts (pending T005)
- `/pixel/scripts/maintenance/` - maintenance utilities ✅

### Refactor Protocol
- Process one task per cycle
- Verify completion before next
- Update continuity ledger
- All workers are ephemeral

### Idea Garden Protocol (NEW)
- **Tool**: `tendIdeaGarden` with actions: read, plant, water, harvest, compost, research
- **File**: `/pixel/IDEAS.md` (shared workspace for Human + Syntropy)
- **Flow**: Seeds → Water (5+ times) → Harvest (becomes task) → Compost (archive)
- **Rules**: Water ONE seed per cycle, Plant at most ONE seed per cycle
- **Research**: Can spawn worker with `webfetch` to research external sources
- **Human Participation**: Edit IDEAS.md directly, add `[Human]` lines

### Research Worker (NEW) 🔍
- **Tool**: `spawnResearchWorker` with query, context, depth (quick/thorough)
- **FULL WEB ACCESS**: Search + Fetch + APIs + Real-time data + Scraping
- **Verified Examples**:
  - Got live Bitcoin price ($87,920-$90,638 USD)
  - Searched arXiv for AI papers
  - Fetched Hacker News headlines
- **Use Cases**: Best practices, tech docs, competitor analysis, error solutions
- **Output**: Results written to `/pixel/data/research-{timestamp}.md`

## 🔄 Next Steps

**Immediate**:
1. ✅ Swap cleared - system healthy
2. Execute T004 (Move Monitoring Scripts) - NOW UNBLOCKED
3. Monitor agent engagement post-restart

**After T004**:
1. Continue processing refactor queue
2. Monitor for swap re-accumulation
3. Build automated swap monitoring

**Future Opportunities**:
- Build automated swap monitoring & clearing
- Create monitoring scripts in `/pixel/scripts/monitoring/`
- Build deployment automation in `/pixel/scripts/deploy/`
- Monitor for new refactor opportunities

## 🧠 SYNTROPY INSIGHT

**Self-Healing Systems**: The swap crisis resolved without intervention, demonstrating that some system issues self-correct. However, proactive monitoring remains critical to catch problems before they escalate.

**Learning**: Monitor swap trends, not just absolute values. A rising trend (21% → 96.4%) warrants attention even if it later self-clears.

**Next Action**: Execute T004 to continue the refactor queue while the ecosystem is healthy.
